FatFind Install Guide
=====================

This guide will help you to set up FatFind on your machine.


Prerequisites
-------------

FatFind currently depends on a few external libraries.
These are:

 * GTK+ >= 2.8
 * libglade2 >= 2.5.1
 * X11 (specifically libXt)
 * ltilib (CVS)
 * OpenDiamond Platform >= 2.0
 * SnapFind >= 1.2


GTK+ and libglade should be available on any modern Linux system,
as well as X11. Make sure you install the development packages
for your system, which usually end in "-devel" or "-dev".
FatFind requires at least version 2.8 of GTK+ and version 2.5.1
of libglade.



ltilib is a image processing and utility library, developed at
the Aachen University of Technology. FatFind uses ltilib for circle
detection and a few other things.

FatFind currently requires the CVS version of ltilib.

 1. Check out ltilib:
       cvs -z3 \
       -d:pserver:anonymous@ltilib.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ltilib \
       co -P ltilib

 2. Build/install ltilib:
       cd ltilib/linux
       [see README for details]
       [note that before you do "make install", you will need to
        also build the "nv" versions of ltilib]
       make ../lib/libltinvr.a
       make ../lib/libltinvd.a
       make install



The OpenDiamond Platform provides the infrastructure for interactive search.

FatFind currently requires at least version 2.0 of the OpenDiamond Platform.

 1. Download the OpenDiamond Platform at http://diamond.cs.cmu.edu/download

 2. Unpack, and install following directions in INSTALL.



SnapFind is another Diamond application, completely separate from FatFind.

SnapFind is needed for just one file, fil_rgb.a. Currently, the easiest
way to build fil_rgb.a is to build SnapFind.

 1. Download SnapFind at http://diamond.cs.cmu.edu/download

 2. Unpack, and build (not necessary to install) following instructions
    in INSTALL.

 3. Look in snapfind/src/target/lib for fil_rgb.a. You will need this
    later to drop into your build of FatFind.



Building FatFind
----------------

Once all prerequisites are installed, it's time to build FatFind.

 1. ./configure --prefix=[someplace]

 2. cp [snapfind_build_location]/src/target/lib/fil_rgb.a data/filter

 3. make

 4. make -f Makefile.filters

 5. make install

If you have any problems during any step, your prerequisites may not
have been installed correctly.



Configuration Files
-------------------

FatFind requires 2 files in "$HOME/.diamond", as described in
the README file in the Diamond distribution. These files are
"gid_map" which maps data repositories to servers, and "name_map"
which maps text names to data repositories.
Search for "Front-end configuration" in Diamond README for details.

FatFind currently only searches the first entry in name_map.



Calibration Files
-----------------

FatFind requires example files to start. It is recommended to choose
3 to 4 adipocyte images for this purpose. The images must be
JPEG images.

 1. Put the calibration images into a new directory.

 2. In the new directory, create a file called "index.txt"
    and list the sample images one by one like this:

     sample1.jpg
     sample2.jpg
     sample3.jpg
     sample4.jpg

 3. When you run FatFind, you will give this filename on the
    command line. Otherwise, you will get the error:
    "No image index given on command line".



Running FatFind
---------------

Once everything is set up, you should be able to run FatFind.

 1. Start Diamond backends (adiskd).

 2. [prefix]/bin/fatfind [calibration_image_dir]/index.txt




Good luck!
